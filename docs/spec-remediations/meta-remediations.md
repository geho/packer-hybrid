# Meta Spec Remediations

## Open Topics

1. **Gaps** – The meta spec’s Purpose section still reads “TBD,” making it unclear how assessments/remediations relate to broader governance goals. _Plan_: define the Purpose, reference governance requirements, and describe how meta orchestrates assessment cadence.
2. **Completeness / Alignment** – Assessment workflow requirements describe dimensions but omit cadence, ownership, and success criteria. _Plan_: add SLA language (e.g., quarterly review), specify who runs `/prompts:openspec-proposal`, and link to `docs/spec-remediations/templates-spec-remediations.md`.
3. **Integrity** – Remediation workflow bullets reference updating `## Open Issues` but don’t mention diagram/test artifacts explicitly. _Plan_: extend the requirement to call out diagram/test updates so implementations can’t skip them.

## Closed Topics

1. _None yet – will populate after the first meta remediation merges._
