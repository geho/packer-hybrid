Open items to revisit after in-flight changes merge:

## Open Topics

2. **Checksum caching/invalidation** – Clarify storage, reuse, and invalidation triggers for caches.
3. **State/repo sync** – Detail integration between builder manifests and `hybridcore.state`, including validation commands.

## Closed Topics
