# Hybridcore Umbrella Spec Gaps

## Open Topics

1. **Duplicates / Redundancies** – Review remaining module-specific requirements in the umbrella spec and convert any lingering duplication into links.

## Closed Topics

1. **Module registry** – Added registry table (with planned modules) plus naming guidance.
2. **Dependency rules** – Documented cross-module dependency guidelines and referencing module Open Issues.
3. **Orchestration diagram** – Added `specs/hybridcore/orchestration-flow.md` and referenced it.
4. **Consistency** – Umbrella spec now references module specs and their remediations/Open Issues.
