# Hybridcore Sources Spec Gaps

1. **Gaps** – Air-gapped workflows (mirrors, offline bundles) lack detail; specify configuration and validation steps.
2. **Completeness** – Security scanning/auditing for repos not defined; add requirements for scanning cadence and reporting.
3. **Alignment** – Manual override policies (force-pin SHAs) should align with security/governance specs; currently unspecified.
4. **Integrity** – Need explicit metadata schema, samples, and CLI visibility requirements.

Remediation: augment spec with air-gap procedures, security scanning steps, manual override governance, and metadata schema examples.
