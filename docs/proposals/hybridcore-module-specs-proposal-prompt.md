/prompts:openspec-proposal Hybridcore module spec layout: Keep `openspec/specs/hybridcore/spec.md` as the umbrella capability and create sibling module specs (`openspec/specs/hybridcore-config/spec.md`, `hybridcore-sources`, etc.) that describe the detailed contracts for each module (config, sources, templates, provisioners, packer, state, logs). Ensure each sub-spec links back to the umbrella spec and vice versa, define naming conventions, and describe how openspec tooling should reference these capabilities. Include pros/cons of the approach and guidance for when to add new sub-specs. Reference: [specs/hybridcore/spec.md](openspec/specs/hybridcore/spec.md)
