# prompt-tracking-policy-proposal-prompt.md

/prompts:openspec-proposal Proposal prompt tracking: Require every `docs/proposals/*.md` file to record when the prompt was first processed (change opened) and when the change was archived, in addition to the canonical spec link. Define the metadata format (timestamps, change IDs) and compliance checks so future proposals can track provenance automatically. Reference: [specs/governance/spec.md](openspec/specs/governance/spec.md)
