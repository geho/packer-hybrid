# Assessment Plan

- Scope: Cross-check the packer-hybrid infrastructure specs against docs and implementation to confirm policies remain aligned with current automation.
- Timeframe: 2025-11-18 through 2025-11-20 (initial sweep; extend if new risks appear).
- Target Specs/Capabilities: openspec/specs related to Hashicorp Packer hybrid builders, provisioning workflows, and shared infra policies referenced by this repository.
- Success Criteria: Each checklist item completed with logged findings, key risks prioritized in summary.md, and open questions converted into actionable TODOs or change proposals.
- Checklist:
  - [x] Cross-check specs vs project policies
  - [x] Cross-check specs vs documentation
  - [ ] Cross-check specs vs implementation artifacts
