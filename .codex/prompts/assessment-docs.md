$ARGUMENTS

<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->

**Guardrails**

- Review `@/AGENTS.md`, `@/agents/startup.md`, `@/openspec/AGENTS.md`, and `@/assessments/AGENTS.md` so documentation checks align with project policies and handover expectations.
- Read-only review; no doc/spec edits here.
- Record mismatches between README/architecture docs/diagrams and specs.

**Workflow**

1. Confirm scope in `plan.md`.
2. Compare each targeted doc/diagram with its corresponding spec:
   - Look for inconsistencies, duplications, omitted scenarios, outdated terminology.
3. Log findings in `docs-findings.md` and summarize in `notes.md` with references.
4. Tag items needing proposals or doc updates for the summary phase.
