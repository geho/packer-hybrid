## Tasks

1. - [x] Expand CLI spec with per-command semantics (arguments, exit codes, validation gates for publish/clean/diag/status/wizard).
2. - [x] Document logging/verbosity behaviour and reference `hybridcore-logs`.
3. - [x] Add command→module mapping diagram and reference it from the spec.
4. - [x] Update `docs/spec-remediations/cli-remediations.md` (move addressed topics to “Closed Topics”, keep remaining items under “Open Topics”).
5. - [x] Run `openspec validate remediate-cli-spec --strict`.
