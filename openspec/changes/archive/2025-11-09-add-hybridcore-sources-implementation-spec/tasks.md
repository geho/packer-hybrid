## Tasks

1. - [ ] Describe repo lifecycle (clone/fetch/checkout/pin), concurrency/air-gap rules, transports, and clean working-tree enforcement.
2. - [ ] Define metadata structures (`state/sources.json`, lock files), atomic writes, schema evolution, and visibility surfaces.
3. - [ ] Cover failure recovery, auditing, manual overrides, and security scanning integrations.
4. - [ ] Mandate testing strategies (mocked git, contract tests, integration suites).
5. - [ ] Link diagrams (`metadata-flow.md`, `recovery-flow.md`, `testing-matrix.md`) from docs/README so they are discoverable.
6. - [ ] Update the proposal prompt to reference the diagrams.
7. - [ ] Run `openspec validate add-hybridcore-sources-implementation-spec --strict`.
