## Tasks

1. - [ ] Document builder inventory layout, naming rules, and composition pipeline feeding packer commands.
2. - [ ] Define deterministic ordering, manifest/checksum generation, and onboarding rules for new OS/platforms.
3. - [ ] Specify builder metadata, validation hooks, and reference checks against repos/state.
4. - [ ] Outline rigorous testing (linters, golden fixtures, packer fmt/validate per builder set, change-detection rules).
5. - [ ] Link diagrams (`composition-flow`, `metadata-map`, `onboarding-checklist`, `testing-matrix`) from architecture/README/docs so they are discoverable.
6. - [ ] Update the proposal prompt to mention the diagrams as required references.
7. - [ ] Run `openspec validate add-hybridcore-templates-implementation-spec --strict`.
