## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Open Issues Tracking

The governance spec SHALL expose a `## Open Issues` section that links to `docs/spec-remediations/governance-remediations.md` so repository-wide policies carry explicit remediation visibility.

#### Scenario: Governance remediations

- **WHEN** an assessment surfaces a governance policy gap
- **THEN** the governance spec MUST point readers to `docs/spec-remediations/governance-remediations.md` until the remediation is implemented.
