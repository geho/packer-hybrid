## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Open Issues Tracking

The meta spec SHALL expose a `## Open Issues` section linking to `docs/spec-remediations/meta-remediations.md` so assessments/remediations remain discoverable at the repository-policy level.

#### Scenario: Meta remediations

- **WHEN** assessment gaps are logged for meta workflows
- **THEN** contributors MUST update `docs/spec-remediations/meta-remediations.md` and ensure the meta spec’s `## Open Issues` section references it until the work is complete.
