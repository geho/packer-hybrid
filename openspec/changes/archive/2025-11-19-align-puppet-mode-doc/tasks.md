# Tasks

## Proposal Clarifications

- [x] None (add questions here if scope changes)

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Verify no concurrent change is editing Puppet mode metadata instructions.
- [x] Replace the outdated draft doc by referencing the canonical spec path (`state/provisioners/<env>/puppet.json`) and remove `docs/drafts/puppet-agent-modes.md` once coverage is in the spec.
- [x] Draft spec delta under `specs/hybridcore-provisioners/spec.md` clarifying the documentation/storage guidance.
- [x] Run `openspec validate align-puppet-mode-doc --strict` after drafting deltas.
- [x] Review with provisioning spec owner/documentation maintainer.
