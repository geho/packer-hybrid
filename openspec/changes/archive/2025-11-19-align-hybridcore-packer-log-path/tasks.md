# Tasks

## Proposal Clarifications

- [x] None (no clarifications required)

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Review `project.md` logging guidance and confirm desired directory structure (`logs/packer/...`).
- [x] Draft spec delta updating the diagnostics requirement, including any diagrams/docs referencing the old path.
- [x] Run `openspec validate align-hybridcore-packer-log-path --strict` and resolve issues.
- [x] Socialize with logging/state spec owners before implementation.
